# LookML Derived Table Conversion (Step 5)

> Classify LookML derived tables and convert them to Malloy patterns. Reference `_concepts.md` for syntax translation. This runs during Step 5 (BUILD) when the prior-art notes flag derived tables.

## Decision Tree

```
derived_table:
├── explore_source: → NDT path
│   ├── Simple aggregation → Malloy (query) extend {}
│   ├── With derived_column: (window functions) → Malloy window function patterns
│   ├── Chained NDTs → dependency ordering, multi-stage computed source
│   └── With bind_filters → flag, no direct Malloy equivalent
└── sql: → PDT path
    ├── Performance-only → strip to base table
    └── Transformation → recommend base table + Malloy dims or upstream dbt
```

## NDT Path (`explore_source:`)

### Simple Aggregation NDT

Express the aggregation as a Malloy query, then build a source from it by
wrapping the query in parentheses and extending it (`from(...)` was removed from
the language and no longer parses):

```malloy
source: source_name is (
  base_source -> {
    group_by: group_field
    aggregate:
      metric_one is count()
      metric_two is sum(amount_field)
  }
) extend {
  primary_key: group_field
  dimension: derived_dim is metric_one > 1
}
```

### NDT with `derived_column:` (Window Functions)

LookML `derived_column:` adds window functions on top of the NDT result. Map to Malloy window function patterns. Call `search_malloy_docs("window functions")` for current syntax.

### Chained NDTs

When one NDT references another's explore_source, determine the dependency order. Build the upstream computed source first, then reference it in the downstream one. Each becomes its own `.malloy` file.

### NDTs with `bind_filters`

No direct Malloy equivalent. Flag for user and propose alternatives:
- Parameterized source (if Malloy supports it; check `search_malloy_docs`)
- Pre-filtered views
- Document the intent and let the user decide

## PDT Path (`sql:`)

### Performance-Only PDT

**Signal:** SQL is essentially `SELECT *, generate_uuid() as pk FROM table WHERE increment_condition` with partitioning/clustering/incremental keys.

**Action:** Use the base table directly. The PDT optimization is Looker-specific. Strip to the actual `FROM` table, resolve any manifest constants (`@{TABLE_NAME}`), and use `conn.table('resolved_table')`.

**Synthetic PK investigation:** If the PDT generates a synthetic PK (`generate_uuid()`, `concat(field_a, field_b)`), the actual grain is unknown. Run queries to determine it:

```malloy
// Check if candidate columns form a unique grain
run: source -> {
  group_by: candidate_pk_field
  aggregate: row_count is count()
  having: row_count > 1
  order_by: row_count desc
  limit: 10
}
```

### Transformation PDT

**Signal:** SQL has JOINs, CTEs, complex WHERE clauses, or computed columns.

**Action:** Flag for user. Recommend:
1. Use the base table + Malloy dimensions for the computed columns
2. Push the transformation to upstream dbt/SQL
3. Only carry forward verbatim if user insists (last resort)

**CRITICAL: Never use `conn.sql()` when Malloy has a native pattern.** For aggregation, window functions (`calculate`), and filtering, use Malloy query-based sources (`table -> { group_by, aggregate } extend {}`). `conn.sql()` is a last resort for patterns with NO Malloy equivalent (UNNEST, PIVOT, dialect-specific functions). Call `search_malloy_docs` before writing any SQL block.

## Long→wide entity-values pivot (custom fields)

A common LookML shape: an entity-attribute-value (EAV) table (custom fields / properties) that LookML widened by joining the same table **N times, once per attribute**. Don't port those N joins. Pivot with **filtered aggregates** in a single query-based source: one aggregate per attribute value, no repeated joins:

```malloy
// EAV table: (entity_id, field_name, field_value), one row per attribute.
// Wide result: one row per entity, one column per attribute of interest.
source: entity_custom_fields is conn.table('custom_field_values') -> {
  group_by: entity_id
  aggregate:
    industry      is field_value.max() { where: field_name = 'industry' }
    tier          is field_value.max() { where: field_name = 'tier' }
    account_owner is field_value.max() { where: field_name = 'account_owner' }
} extend {
  primary_key: entity_id
}
```

`field_value.max()` (the `expr.aggregate() { where: … }` filtered-aggregate form, same shape as `x.sum() { where: … }` in `skill:malloy-gotchas-modeling`) collapses the one matching row per attribute to a scalar; `max` is a native Malloy aggregate that works on strings. Do **not** reach for `any_value`/`ANY_VALUE`: that's a warehouse SQL function, not a Malloy aggregate, and would force a raw-SQL escape that (per the median gotcha in `skill:malloy-gotchas-modeling`) doesn't compile in aggregate position anyway.

Then `join_one` this once onto the entity source. This replaces LookML's N self-joins with one grouped scan: fewer joins, one pass, and new attributes are one more `aggregate:` line. (If an attribute can legitimately repeat per entity, that's not a wide column, so model it as a nested/joined detail instead.)

## Examples

Grounded in real patterns from `lookml/block-google-cloud-billing/` and `lookml/bq_thelook/`.
