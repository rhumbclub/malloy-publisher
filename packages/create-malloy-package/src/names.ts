 * Names that cannot be used as a bare Malloy source name. Two disjoint hazards,

 *
 * - Grammar keywords, rejected at parse time with "'<word>' is a reserved word, so
 *   to use it as a name you must quote it".
 * - Malloy standard function names, rejected later, once a dialect is attached,
 *   with "Cannot redefine '<word>'". A parse-only sweep does not see these, which
 *   is why they were missing for so long.
 *
 * A derived source name landing on either is suffixed (below) rather than quoted.
 * The query API no longer requires that — it quotes `sourceName`/`queryName` as
 * identifiers when it composes `run: <source> -> <view>`, so a name needing
 * quotes is queryable there — but a quote-requiring name is still hostile to
 * every place Malloy is written by hand (ad-hoc `query` text, notebooks, the
 * model's own views), so the generator keeps producing plain names.
 *
 * This list is derived from the installed @malloydata/malloy rather than curated
 * by hand, and names.spec.ts re-derives both sets from that package on every run.
 * A Malloy upgrade that adds a keyword or a standard function therefore fails the
 * suite instead of silently shipping packages the server cannot compile. To
 * regenerate: run `bun test src/names.spec.ts` and add the words it names.
