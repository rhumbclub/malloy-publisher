    *    import. `import { gated }` in a middle file, `source: qs is gated ->
    *    {...}`, then `import { qs }` locally: `contents` holds only `qs`, and
    *    `gated`'s gate lives on the inline ref.
    *  - a composite's resolved member (`query.compositeResolvedSourceDef`) is a
    *    synthesized struct that is never in either collection.
    *
    * Both were missed by an earlier version of this sweep, which therefore
    * answered `false` for a genuinely gated entry point and skipped the walk —
    * handing storage and pre-aggregation routing back the dependence on a BUILD
    * path's refusal that the guard exists to remove. {@link
    * derivedStructsReachable} follows both, transitively.
    *
    * With those, `false` genuinely means "no gate is findable" — and unreadable
    * IR returns `true`, so every remaining inexactness falls on the side of
    * walking anyway.
    *
    * It exists so a deployment with pre-aggregation enabled and no gates
    * anywhere does not start paying a live compile per query for a case it
    * cannot hit; see `getQueryResults`'s routing pre-check.

   /**
    * Deny a request that enters a gated source through a derivation the
    * REQUEST ITSELF declared, when the entry-point walk collected no gate for
    * the entry point actually being run.
    *
    * ## What it is defending
    *
    * The dimension form of `#(authorize)` is discovered as an annotated boolean
    * field on the entry struct's own `fields` and enforced by grafting
    * `where: \`<name>\`` onto that entry BY NAME. A request that declares its
    * own derivation dropping that field — `source: mine is X extend { except:
    * authorized }`, or an `accept:` list that omits it — therefore presents IR
    * with no gate anywhere on it, and nothing downstream catches it: the query
    * boundary admits a derivation over a curated source, and a zero-gate answer
    * also un-blocks storage / pre-aggregation routing. Under the retired string
    * form the annotation sat on the `source:` line and survived a field-level
    * `except:`/`accept:`, so the same text failed CLOSED there. This is the
    * dimension form's own regression, reachable by anyone who can post a query.
    *
    * ## Why the run target comes from the COMPILED query
    *
    * {@link resolveAuthorizeSourceFromRunnable} — not a scan of the request
    * text — decides what is being run, for the same reason the compiled
    * boundary backstop does: Malloy executes the LAST `run:`, reads around
    * comments, and resolves a `query:` indirection, so any of those defeats a
    * first-match text scan in BOTH directions. Reading the first `run:` misses
    * a laundered derivation that a later `run:` actually executes, and it also
    * DENIES a query whose laundered alias is declared but never run (the
    * executed target being some ungated source) — a false positive on text the
    * author published. The compiled target has neither failure mode.
    *
    * ## The default is DENY
    *
    * When the compiled entry point is not a `modelDef.contents` key — the
    * request declared it — this denies unless the scan POSITIVELY establishes a
    * complete chain to model-declared ungated sources
    * ({@link requestChainProvesUngated}). It does not ask "did I find a
    * derivation reaching a gated source"; it asks "did I prove this reaches
    * only ungated ones", and treats every other answer as a denial.
    *
    * That inversion is the substance of this defence, and it is what three
    * earlier rounds got wrong. Asking the question the other way round meant an
    * UNREADABLE declaration read as "not a request-declared derivation" and was
    * admitted, so every divergence between the scan and Malloy's grammar was a
    * full bypass rather than a false positive — and they kept coming: a
    * declaration hidden in a comment or forged in a string literal, then a
    * backtick-quoted name whose contents blanked every declaration after it
    * (an innocuous `` dimension: `q'` is 1 `` was enough), then a parenthesised
    * base, then a non-ASCII name. Each was found after the previous round
    * shipped. With the default inverted, the same class of miss costs an
    * over-denial on a legitimate derivation instead.
    *
    * ## Why the DERIVATION chain is still read from the text
    *
    * Because Malloy does not keep one. Measured against `@malloydata/malloy`:
    * an ad-hoc `source: mine is X extend { … }` compiles to a struct whose
    * `sourceRegistry` entry is a `source_registry_reference` to `mine` ITSELF,
    * whose `referenceID` is unset, and for which `resolveDeclaredSource`
    * answers `{kind: "none"}` — identically for `except: authorized`, for a
    * trivial `extend {}`, and for a derivation of an UNGATED sibling. The IR
    * cannot tell those three apart, so "this entry point's ancestry reaches a
    * gated source" is not a readable property and the decision cannot be made
    * on the IR alone.
    *
    * The coarser IR-only property that IS readable — "the compiled entry point
    * is ephemeral (no `modelDef.contents` key) and reads the same relation as
    * some gated source" — was implemented and measured, and it is wrong: a
    * gated source and the ungated siblings an author deliberately publishes
    * beside it normally read the SAME table, so it denies the documented Q16
    * contract (`source: j is plain extend { join_one: base_locked … }` — joins
    * are not gated) and ad-hoc composition over an ungated source
    * (`source: mine is plain extend { measure: … }`). Both are pinned in
    * `authorize_integration.spec.ts`. So the defence is text-shaped by
    * necessity, not by preference.
    *
    * The scan is still hardened, because a miss now costs a legitimate
    * derivation rather than a leak and that is worth minimising too: comments
    * and string-literal bodies are blanked and backtick spans skipped whole
    * before the scan ({@link stripMalloyCommentsAndLiterals}), the pattern
    * reads Unicode identifiers, an optional parameter list and a parenthesised
    * base, and the map over-collects (every base per name, `query:` included)
    * — which is safe in the same direction, since an extra edge adds a name
    * that must also be proven.
    *
    * Known over-denials, all of the safe kind: a derivation over
    * `compose(...)` or a parameterised source resolves to a base name the walk
    * cannot place, so it denies. Both need an experimental flag to compile at
    * all. A request-declared source over a raw `connection.table(...)` /
    * `.sql(...)` never reaches here — restricted-mode compilation refuses it
    * first.
    *
    * ## The line, and what it costs
    *
    * A MODEL-declared derivation that drops the gate field keeps its
    * documented fail-open (`docs/authorize.md`): the request text declares no
    * alias for it, so it never enters the walk. That is the accepted
    * author-discipline gap, and this does not narrow it.
    *
    * Denying adds no restriction to request-declared shapes that KEEP the gate
    * field: those ALREADY denied — including the trivial `extend {}` and an
    * `accept:` list naming the gate dimension — because
    * {@link resolveGraftTarget} has no `modelDef.contents` key for an ephemeral
    * entry point to graft onto. This makes the gate-DROPPING shapes agree with
    * them instead of being the one spelling that succeeded. It is also why the
    * answer is the cannot-attach 403 and not a 200 with zero rows: there is no
    * gate left to evaluate, so supplying the right givens changes nothing.

    * The bind pair for a notebook cell that must graft against its OWN scope:
    * a `recompile` that grafts the cell's already-compiled queryDef, and the
    * `proveGraft` that checks it. Returned together because supplying one
    * without the other is a silent fail-OPEN — see `prove` below.
    *
    * Why the queryDef is grafted rather than recompiled. A cell that both
    * brings in a gated source and runs it in the SAME cell has no earlier
    * cell to graft against, so its own model is the graft scope. That scope
    * cannot be re-entered by recompiling the cell's text: the grafted clone is
    * loaded from a ModelDef and therefore has no base URL, so a relative
    * `import` in that text fails to resolve outright ("In order to use
    * relative imports, you must compile a file via a URL") — which is exactly
    * what an import-and-run cell contains. `_loadQueryFromQueryDef` binds the
    * already-compiled queryDef instead, translating nothing.
    *
    * The cell's queryDef holds an INLINED copy of the run-target struct (its
    * source arrived unexported through an `import`), so the condition is
    * appended to that copy. The copy is deep-cloned first: `cell.runnable` is
    * memoized across requests, and mutating it in place would leak one
    * caller's filter into the next caller's query.
