 * Dashboard discovery: the Malloyyo `# artifact` grammar, read out of a
 * package's `dashboards/*.malloy` files into the manifest the REST surface
 * serves.
 *
 * Ported from Malloyyo's `@malloyyo/mcp-engine` (`artifacts.ts`,
 * `given-specs.ts` — MIT) rather than depended on: that is a private workspace
 * package. The *grammar* is the contract, so one model repo largely works
 * unchanged in both products; the code is an implementation detail a shared
 * malloydata package is expected to absorb later. One property deliberately
 * diverges, the grid width; see `docs/malloyyo-dashboards-design.md`
 * §Where Publisher diverges.
 *
 * A dashboard is `## artifact { tiles=[…] }` at model level: named views that
 * run separately and combine into one grid Publisher lays out. That is the form
 * to author, and the only one that can span sources — a nest's pipeline starts
 * from its own query's source, so no single Malloy result spans two.
 *
 * `# artifact` on a `query:` is also served, and is the same thing a notebook
 * cell shows: one Malloy result that @malloydata/render lays out from the query's
 * own `# dashboard {columns=N}`. That is Malloy's rendering feature rather than a
 * second dashboard grammar, and the docs no longer offer it as an alternative.
 *
 * Both read the same grid-width spelling and the same per-tile layout tags, so a
 * view carries its own layout whichever way it is consumed.
 *
 * A `dashboards/*.malloy` carrying neither tag is a shared include: skipped, not
 * an error.
