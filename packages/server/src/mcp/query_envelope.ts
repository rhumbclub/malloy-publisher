/**
 * The agent-facing shape for a query result, matched to what Credible's
 * `execute_query` returns.
 *
 * Matching matters for a specific workflow: a data app is authored locally
 * against Publisher and then served through Credible. An agent that sees one
 * response shape while developing and a different one in production has to
 * learn both, and a shared skill cannot describe either without forking. So the
 * field names here are Credible's, deliberately, including the leading
 * underscores and the mixed casing of `renderLogErrors`.
 *
 * Also following Credible: the truncation fields appear only when truncation
 * happened, rather than always carrying `false`.
 *
 * The two `_limit_...` fields are new to both products. Three separate things
 * can shorten a result and only one of them was ever reported:
 *
 *   1. The query row cap, pushed into the SQL. A query with no `limit:` of its
 *      own gets DEFAULT_QUERY_ROW_LIMIT (1000) rows, which is far under
 *      PUBLISHER_MAX_QUERY_ROWS, so nothing raises and nothing warns. An agent
 *      reports statistics on a silent sample. This is why `_limit_hit` exists,
 *      and unlike the others it is not derivable by a client: the cap depends on
 *      server config and on the query's own LIMIT.
 *   2. The hard ceiling (maxRows / maxBytes), which throws 413 and is loud.
 *   3. The payload cap below, which degrades to a truncated result plus a
 *      warning instead of overflowing the client's per-result limit.
 *
 * `_limit_hit` is a bound, not a total. The server cannot know the true row
 * count, because the database applied the cap. Landing exactly on the limit is
 * the only evidence available that rows were left behind.
 *
 * It is reported only when the cap was the server default, which `_limit_source`
 * names. `resolveModelQueryRowLimit` folds the query's own `limit:`/`top:` into
 * the same number, so equality also holds every time an author limited the query
 * on purpose: three of the eight views in the bundled storefront example use
 * `top:`, and each would otherwise report its complete answer as cut off. The
 * silent sample this exists to catch only ever happens under the default.

 * the truncation existed to respect. `_returned_rows` is measured at `total`
 * first, whose digit width is at least that of any value it ends up holding, so
 * the finished payload stays under the limit. Credible's `_truncate_rows` does
 * the same thing for the same reason.
 *
 * The search can land on zero rows, which needs its own wording rather than
 * "Showing 0 of N rows": that reads as an empty result set, and an agent will
 * report "no rows matched" for what is really one row too large to send. It is
 * reachable, because the hard ceiling upstream is maxBytes (50MB by default), so
 * a single row carrying a large text or JSON column passes
 * assertWithinModelByteLimit and arrives here. Both wordings are measured,
 * and the search uses whichever is longer, so swapping one for the other after
 * the fact cannot push the payload back over the cap.
 *
 * One case cannot be fixed by dropping rows: when the envelope minus its rows
 * already exceeds the limit (a very wide schema in `_meta`). The result is then
 * returned over-limit rather than emptied further, and the warning says so.
