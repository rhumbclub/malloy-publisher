// workflow-focused rather than a tool catalog, which the client already gets
// from listTools, so it does not drift as the tool set changes.
// SECURITY: this is delivered pre-authorization to any connecting client, so it
// must stay STATIC. It may interpolate module-scope string LITERALS (see
// RELOAD_FAILURE_IS_SAFE, shared with the tool description so the two cannot
// drift). Not "constants": `const x = process.env.FOO` is a module-scope
// constant and would put deployment config into an unauthenticated string. It
// must never interpolate environment, package, connection, or request data.
const MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = `Malloy Publisher serves one or more Malloy semantic-model packages, so you can discover what data exists and answer questions against it, grounded in the names the model actually defines.

Start with malloy_getContext. Call it with no arguments to list the environments (each with its packages), with an environment to list its packages, with a package to list its sources, and with a package plus a plain-English question to get the sources, views, and fields most relevant to it. Use the names it returns verbatim and do not guess. Then run a query with malloy_executeQuery. To change a model: validate the edit with malloy_compile, save it, then call malloy_reloadPackage so the new sources and views become queryable by name without restarting the server. ${RELOAD_FAILURE_IS_SAFE} After every model edit, call malloy_reloadPackage before querying: the server serves the model compiled at the last load, not your files, and a watch-mode save that fails to compile is otherwise silent. An empty malloy_getContext result does not mean the package is empty; check malloy_getStatus for load errors and stale packages before concluding there is no data.

To build a model from a database rather than from an existing package, start with malloy_searchDatabaseSchema: it lists the connections, their schemas, and their tables, and ranks those tables against a plain-English description of the data you want. Each table it returns carries the source line to start from. It returns names and types only: no row value is returned.

Task-specific guidance is served as prompts you can fetch by name: malloy-getting-started to begin, malloy-modeling to build or change a model, malloy-analysis to explore and answer questions, and malloy-review to check correctness.

Results and any charts render in the Publisher web UI on the REST port (4000 by default).`;
