# Carry over the DuckDB extensions baked during the builder stage's
# `build:server-only` (packages/server's build runs bake-duckdb-extensions).
# They live in ~/.duckdb/extensions/v<version>/, which the runtime engine reads
# at INSTALL/LOAD time -- so the server finds them on disk and skips the network
# fetch. Copying the baked cache from the builder keeps a single bake mechanism
# (the server build) instead of re-running it here. The CLI (base-deps) and
# runtime engine are pinned to the same DuckDB version, so all agree on one dir.

# The Snowflake extension is a wrapper over the ADBC Snowflake driver, and
# `INSTALL snowflake FROM community` does NOT bring it — the extension ships
# alone, the driver is a separate artifact. Without it the extension installs,
# LOADs and answers snowflake_version() perfectly well, and then every
# snowflake_query() fails at run time with "ADBC Snowflake driver
# (libadbc_driver_snowflake.so) not found".
#
# Placed HERE, after the COPY above, rather than earlier: the extension resolves
# the driver by calling dladdr on ITSELF and looking beside the loaded object, so
# the driver has to sit next to whichever snowflake.duckdb_extension the runtime
# actually loads. That directory is discovered rather than reconstructed from a
# platform string — the CLI (base-deps) and the bake (@duckdb/node-api, in the
# builder) each write their own, and this is the layer that ships.
#
# Downloaded directly rather than through the upstream installer's `curl … | sh`,
# and checked against the digest GitHub publishes: this is a 16MB native library
# dlopen'd into the server process, and a version tag is mutable — an asset can
# be re-uploaded under it. Pin the bytes, not the name.
#
# No `|| echo` fallback, unlike the extension install above: a failed fetch FAILS
# THE BUILD. That tolerance is exactly what let this ship broken. An image without
# the driver cannot answer a single Snowflake query and must not leave the builder
# reporting success. The closing `test` is the verification — snowflake_version()
# cannot serve as one, being a scalar that never touches the driver.
#
# When bumping DUCKDB_VERSION, re-check this: the community extension moves with
# DuckDB and the driver ABI may move with it, and a mismatch surfaces only at
# query time.
